# Car List Demo

I used the Autolist API to make a simple version of their web app that renders a list of cars based on search parameters.

The API has the following URL pattern: 
https://www.autolist.com/search?page=1&latitude=30.3414&location=Austin%2C+TX&longitude=-97.7312&make=Jeep&ads=web&price_min=5000&price_max=9000

## How to run Car List

 ```
git clone https://github.com/can619/Zeta-Car-List.git
```

```
cd Zeta-Car-List
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run start
```
